# Assignment 5 - Language Detection
The portfolio for __Language Analytics S22__ consists of 5 projects (4 class assignments and 1 self-assigned project). This is the __fifth and final assignment__ in the portfolio. 

## 1. Contribution
The initial assignment was made partly in collaboration with others from the course, but the final code is my own. I made several adjustments to the code since I first handed it in.

Utils made by Ross.
